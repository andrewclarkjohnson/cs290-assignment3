Tasks: Got more working; as soon as I finally figure out one part and think I can do this, the next part seems next to impossible; most of the morning has been painfully frustrating and I wish it wasn't too late to drop the course; haven't been able to get 150 items per page; the search box will not work. Seems to reload the page each time
