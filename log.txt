Tasks: Had to figure out why code passing test yesterday not working today; tried javascript lint sites to help; re-downloaded blank functions.js code and began copy/pasting bits of yesterdays code into it - things started working :) Apparently something I added late in yesteray's code broke earlier stuff - very frustrating! @10:42 finally code first new bit of code to work today - parseGit; after lots more reading finally getting the idea of what is expected for MessageLog; got constructor to work with empty methods. Need a break.
